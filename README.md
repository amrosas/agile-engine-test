# agile-engine-test

This is my attempt to solve the code challenge. In order to run it you'll have to open two terminals, and run the following commands

```
cd agile-engine-node
npm start
```

```
cd agile-engine-react
npm start
```

Unfortunately I ran into some CORS issues when I tried to get the information from the backend, that's the reason why you'll see some hardcoded jsons to mock the backend response.
However, I can confirm that both the frontend and the backend works as expected.
